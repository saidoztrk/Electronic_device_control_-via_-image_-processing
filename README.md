 # 🤖 Computer Vision-Based Control of Electronic Devices using ESP32  This project enables gesture-based control of electronic devices using computer vision and the ESP32 microcontroller. It allows users to control home appliances or other electronic systems with simple hand movements, creating a touchless, wireless control interface.  ---  ## 📌 Features  - ✋ Real-time hand gesture detection using computer vision (OpenCV) - 📡 Wireless communication with ESP32 via serial or Wi-Fi - 🔌 Control of physical electronic devices (e.g., LEDs, fans, smart relays) - ⚙️ Easy-to-adapt modular design for various gestures and devices  ---  ## 🧠 How It Works  1. The camera captures a live video stream. 2. Hand gestures are detected using image processing techniques (e.g., contour detection or ML-based models). 3. Recognized gestures are mapped to specific control commands (e.g., turn on/off). 4. Commands are sent to ESP32 via serial (USB) or Wi-Fi (ESP-NOW/MQTT). 5. ESP32 activates or deactivates the connected electronic device.  ---  ## 🛠️ Technologies Used  - Python (for image processing) - OpenCV (gesture detection) - ESP32 (microcontroller) - Arduino IDE / MicroPython - Serial or Wi-Fi communication - Optional: TensorFlow (for ML-based gesture recognition)  ---  ## 🔌 Hardware Requirements  - ESP32 development board   - USB cable (or Wi-Fi setup)   - Relay module or other control interface   - Power source   - Webcam or USB camera    ---  ## 🧪 Example Gestures  | Gesture         | Action              | |-----------------|---------------------| | Open palm       | Turn device ON       | | Closed fist     | Turn device OFF      | | Thumbs up       | Toggle state         |  You can add or train custom gestures for your use case.
